## <font color='#0065bd'>Biography</font>

Since 2024, I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the Wirtschaftsuniversitaet Wien (WU Vienna).

Between 2022 and 2024, I was a [Bernoulli Instructor](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/bernoulli-instructors/) in the Department of Mathematics of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).

I received my PhD from EPFL, advised by Victor Panaretos. Before joining EPFL about 5 years ago, I obtained my Master and Bachelor degrees from Charles University (Prague), advised by Jaromír Antoch. During (and shortly after) my Master studies, I spend some time in Zurich and Munich, and I was privileged to work with Sara van de Geer, Felix Krahmer and Claudia Klüppelberg.
